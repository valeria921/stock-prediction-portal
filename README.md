## üöÄ Project Summary

This application is a full-stack stock price prediction portal that allows users to visualize and compare machine learning‚Äìbased stock forecasts with real historical data. The platform uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to analyze stock trends and generate predictions based on past data.

The model is trained on the first 70% of a real 10-year dataset (e.g., 2015‚Äì2021), and predicts the last 30% (e.g., 2022‚Äì2025). Since actual values are available for the predicted period, the app provides an interactive way to compare predictions with real data, offering insights into the model's accuracy.
